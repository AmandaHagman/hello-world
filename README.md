Getting to know you, getting to know all about your.. Github
##Amanda M. Hagman
Today, I am learning to use GitHub. I have used R for the past year. Currently, I am using R to do data wrangling for Utah State University. My project tracks student involvement in various campus activities to see if participation influences semester-to-semester persistence. The application for identifying impact of student involvement comes from Civitas Learning and is called Impact. I tidy data, determine appropriate participation level cut-offs, merge all available comparison students for the analysis, and pull the data into Impact.
